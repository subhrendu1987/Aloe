      <h2>Traditional Internet-of-Things (IoT) relies on the cloud oriented services. Cloud oriented services increase operational expenditure (opex) and  due to following reasons.</h2>

    <div class="holder_content">
      <ol> 
        <li> Cloud lease time is one of the primary opex for IoT infrastructures</li>
        <li> The data forwarding cost is also increased for the client as the data requires to be sent to the cloud service provider.</li>
        <li> IoT traffics are short and bursty in nature. Therefore, it increases network management overhead. </li>
        <li> The infrastructure devices are failure prone which affects the network management policies </li>

      <h2>In-network processing can avoid some of the problems. In-network processing uses residual resouces of networking devices for data processing.</h2>

        <ol> 
        <li> It Can reduce cloud expenses significantly.</li>
        <li> Data forwarding cost and utilization of bottleneck links are reduced in acse of in-network processing.</li>
        <li> In-network processing can provide security as the data need not leave the network.</li>
        <li> It can provide higher response time in comparison to cloud infrastruce.</li>
        <li> However, network management overhead increases as the internal data processing units may migrate from time to time from one device to another device.</li>
        <li> Increase in failure probability also affects the total operation.</li>
